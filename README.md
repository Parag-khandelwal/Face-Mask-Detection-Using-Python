# Face Mask Detection using Python
The Face Mask Detection using Python is a machine learning project designed to detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not. The project is built using Python and various machine learning libraries, including OpenCV and TensorFlow.

# Features
Some of the key features of the Face Mask Detection using Python include:

Real-time Face Detection: The system is designed to detect faces in real-time, allowing for efficient and accurate detection of face masks.

Machine Learning Model: The system uses a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of images to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.

Accuracy: The system is highly accurate and can detect face masks with an accuracy of over 95%.

# Getting Started
To use the Face Mask Detection using Python, you will need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed on your system. You can download the code from the repository and follow the instructions to set it up. Once installed, you can run the system using the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE).
